Description:
    Wrap any external service with an Engine.

Example:
    Let's say your Rails application wants to send email using Postmark API.

    Generate an engine to contain all code related to this interface:
        rails generate uniformity:engine Postmark

    This will create:
        engines/<your_application>-postmark/app
        engines/<your_application>-postmark/bin
        engines/<your_application>-postmark/config
        engines/<your_application>-postmark/lib
        engines/<your_application>-postmark/Gemfile
        engines/<your_application>-postmark/<your_application>-postmark.gemspec
        engines/<your_application>-postmark/Rakefile
        engines/<your_application>-postmark/README.md
